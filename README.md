# python cantera project with GUI
This is a project for simulating pressure loss in a leaking tank containing flammable mixture of gases.

After running the code, the GUI should launch.

The parameters for the simulation are set in the GUI.

Depending on the conditions, an ignition of the gas mixture may occur.

The GUI provides plots of pressure and temperature, as well as their maximum values.
